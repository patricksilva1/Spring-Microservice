# Spring-Microservices
Microservices with Spring Boot.

>Microservice architectures are the ‘new normal’. Building small, self-contained, ready to run applications can bring great flexibility and added resilience to your code. Spring Boot’s many purpose-built features make it easy to build and run your microservices in production at scale.

## What are Microservices?
> Microservices are a modern approach to software whereby application code is delivered in small, manageable pieces, independent of others.

## Why build Microservices?
> Their small scale and relative isolation can lead to many additional benefits, such as easier maintenance, improved productivity, greater fault tolerance, better business alignment, and more.

## Microservices with Spring Boot:
> With Spring Boot, your microservices can start small and iterate fast. That’s why it has become the de facto standard for Java™ microservices.
